# Sorting-Visualizer
Check out the live demo of the Sorting Visualizer: [Sorting Visualizer](https://easy-sorting-visualizer.netlify.app/)

This is a sorting visualizer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort, Cycle Sort, and Comb Sort. The visualizer provides an interactive way to understand how these sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process in real-time.

## Features
* **Responsive Design**: The visualizer is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Sorting Algorithms**: The application includes implementations of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort, Cycle Sort, and Comb Sort. You can choose and visualize any of these algorithms to observe the sorting process.
* **Colorful Visualization**: Each algorithm is visualized using color-coded bars representing elements to be sorted. The bars change color to provide a clear indication of the sorting progress and help understand the algorithm's behavior.
* **User Interaction**: The application allows you to adjust the speed of the animation to observe the sorting process at different paces, as well as change the size of the array.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Select a sorting algorithm from the provided options.
4. Adjust the animation speed if desired.
5. Click the "Start" button to initiate the sorting visualization.
6. Observe the bars animating and rearranging to visualize the sorting process.
7. Reset the visualization as needed.
8. Explore different algorithms to compare their behavior and efficiency.
